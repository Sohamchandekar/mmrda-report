                        <h3>Repayment Timeline Overview</h3>
                        <p>The chart below shows the overall repayment trend across the entire loan period.</p>
                        <div class="chart-container">

                        </div>
                        <p>From 2025 to 2030, the repayment amount grows steadily from ₹2,515.7 Cr to ₹8,990.2 Cr, marking a phase of financial ramp-up. This growth trend continues into the mid-2030s, stabilizing above ₹9,000 Cr annually between 2031 and 2038. The year 2038 represents the peak of repayment commitments, with a total repayment of ₹9,156.3 Cr—the highest across the entire timeline.</p><br>
                        <p>Starting in 2039, a gradual decline begins, reflecting a winding down of repayment obligations. This decline becomes sharp after 2042, dropping to ₹6,331.2 Cr in 2043 and further to ₹429.0 Cr by 2049. The final years, from 2050 to 2053, show very minimal repayments, eventually reaching ₹0.0 Cr in 2053, signaling the end of the loan cycle. This pattern aligns with a typical balloon repayment model—larger payments in the middle years with a tapering finish. </p>
                        <p>It underscores the importance of mid-term financial planning while offering relief in the longer horizon.</p>

                        <p><b>1. Peak repayment activity</b> is concentrated in February, March, and September, consistently across the high-debt years (2030–2038).</p>
                        <p><b>2. The middle band (2030–2038)</b> shows the most intense repayment burden, aligning with the peak years of the loan schedule.</p>
                        <p><b>3. Post-2045,</b> the repayment values gradually decrease, with lighter shades indicating a tapering of obligations.</p>
                        <p><b>4. Minimal repayment activity</b> is seen in November, December, and January, suggesting more flexibility in these months for other financial planning.</p><br>

                                <li>Initiate early accumulation during low-obligation years (2025–2027 and post-2045) to create financial buffers.</li>
